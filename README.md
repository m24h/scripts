# scripts
My useful small scripts toolbox

Simple, small, easy to use, but you should install libraries in need. 

## filter.bat
A wrapped PYTHON script. It uses tkinter to provide windows UI, and uses scipy and matplotlib to provide FFT ploting, filter designing and data filtering.
Several IIR and FIR methods are provided.

## regren.bat
A wrapped PERL script. Using regular expressions to rename files in bulk.
